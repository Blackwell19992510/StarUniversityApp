                    More than 2000 years ago, when Alexander and his Greek hordes were at the doorstep of India, plundering the hill forts of Aornos and treacherously slaughtering the Ashvaka combatants (forefathers of the modern Afghans, according to some) after receiving their submission, a Brahmin teacher embarked upon a journey to the east, to find out someone who would save the people from the Greek slaughter machine. This teacher, Chanakya, was the professor of Economics in the Takshashila University, located in the capital of the then Gandhara Kingdom, which, along with the Kambojas, formed the boundary kingdoms of the Indo Aryan culture.
                    Taxila or Takshashila, in old India now modern-day Pakistan, was an early Hindu and Buddhist centre of learning. According to scattered references which were only fixed a millennium later it may have dated back to at least the 5th century BC. Some scholars date Takshashila's existence back to the 6th century BC. The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was most likely still provided on an individualistic basis.
                    Takshashila is described in some detail in later JƒÅtaka tales, written in Sri Lanka around the 5th century AD.
                    It became a noted centre of learning at least several centuries BC, and continued to attract students until the destruction of the city in the 5th century AD. Takshashila is perhaps best known because of its association with Chanakya. The famous treatise Arthashastra (Sanskrit for The knowledge of Economics) by Chanakya, is said to have been composed in Takshashila itself. Chanakya (or Kautilya), the Maurya Emperor Chandragupta and the Ayurvedic healer Charaka studied at Taxila.
                    Generally, a student entered Takshashila at the age of sixteen. The Vedas and the Eighteen Arts, which included skills such as archery, hunting, and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school, medical school, and school of military science.
